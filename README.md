# Horiseon Accesibility Refactor

## Description

This refactor solved multiple accesibility and function issues with the Horiseon website. These fixes include: changing multiple "div" elements to semantic elements more descriptive of their content, adding alt attributes to all images to improve clarity for screen readers, and organizing the CSS code to be as clear and concise as possible.
